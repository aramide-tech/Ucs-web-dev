    <h1>Revoluton is true</h1>
    
    <p>In their current status of library independent from public, academic, and archival libraries,
        special libraries are a recent phenomenon, although it is difficult to determine when they
        began to be recognised as a distinct subset of libraries due to the highly individualistic and
        independent nature of most special libraries. Perhaps, the closest date to assign to the
        beginnings of special libraries in the modern sense is 1909, the year that the Special Libraries
        Association, one of the oldest and largest library advocacy groups specifically concerned
        with special libraries, was founded. It was led by John Cotton Dana, who served as its first
        president from 1909 to 1911. Describing the history of special libraries in the modern sense
        of the word is therefore difficult, as the only criteria for defining a special library is that it is a
        library – itself an often nebulous term – that is not a national, research, reference, public,
        academic, children’s, or archival library. </p>
